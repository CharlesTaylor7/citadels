In the reference folder, there is a rust implementation of the game. 

For Typescript:
- use plain objects and functions instead of classes
- use type aliases instead of interfaces
- use unions instead of enums
- avoid any
- avoid type assetions
- avoid try-catch, let things crash, I want to see full stack traces
- don't wrap things in "result" types. just return the thing
- Don't write new comments. Copy over pre-existing comments if any exist. If there are no comments in the rust code, don't write any comments.

For React:
- use tprc for most database queries, mutations and subscriptions
- use loaders sparingly for information that doesn't change very often. like the logged in user's info.
