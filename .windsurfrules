Please focus on the current prompt.
I am writing out specifications in Features.md, but don't start working on them until I say so.

Please do not edit these folders/files:
- .windsurfrules
- README.md
- FEATURES.md
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config.ts
- yarn.lock
- .yarnrc.yml
- .gitignore
- .jj/
- .git/
- drizzle.config.ts

In the reference folder, there is a rust implementation of the game. 
I need help porting the logic over to typescript.
These are the core roles:
- Assassin
- Thief
- Magician
- King
- Bishop
- Merchant
- Architect
- Warlord



The rust code uses Result types. For the typescript don't wrap the return values in Result types. Just either return the value directly or throw an error.
