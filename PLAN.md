# Intro
This is my plan to resuccistate the project.

## Deploy
Redpeloy to Azure. Limited to 2 free servers on Fly.io, but I want to learn Azure. So move it over and see how it goes.

Current plan is to use Terraform and deploy this as-is. Because right now the project is not dependent on a database. 


## Poetry
Build a dummy project using poetry and SQLx to write a simple REST API server.
Try to suss out pain points of building it out to be the citadels api server.
Figure it if SSE is a good fit.

## Wasm

Figure out if we can compile the citadels library to wasm, and then call rom a node server.

## Glue
Glue together the best parts of previous implementations.
Angular custom elements
React based lobby
Rust based core game logic
