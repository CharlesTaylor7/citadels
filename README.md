## Citadels
This is a web app for playing the card game [Citadels](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/478/citadels).

## Goals
- Support all characters and roles
- Learn htmx, practice web dev


## Feature set
 - All 30 unique districts
 - All 27 game characters.
 - Game config for picking roles and districts.


## Dev commands
For most commands: use mprocs.

## Logging
The logger offers five levels:
    - error
    - warn
    - info
    - debug
    - trace

This is excessive, and I will try to stick to 3:
    - error
    - debug
    - info

### Installing deps

To install a new dep:
1. Comment out the 2nd line from .cargo/config.toml. So it looks like:
`# replace-with = "vendored-sources"`
2. `cargo add foo`
3. `cargo vendor`
4. Uncomment .cargo/config.toml. 

You might think this is a lot of friction for adding deps. This is a good thing. Vendoring deps makes it so that the docker image can build more readily, and makes our codebase more resistant to supply chain attacks. 
The friction makes me think twice before adding a new dep.


## Tech Stack 
Tech Stack:
- Frontend:
    - htmx
    - hyperscript (as needed)
    - interactjs for drag 'n drop
- Backend 
    - Rust, stable compiler. No nightly features
    - axum
    - Askama for templating. (Jinja clone for Rust)

Evaluating:
    - sqlite for two use cases:
        - game backups via action logs
        - saving preferred game configuration

## Releases
How to release:
- deploy.sh

## Secret management

Script to generate a new signing key:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```
In prod use `fly secret`.
In dev, use the .env file.

Non secret env vars can go in fly.toml
