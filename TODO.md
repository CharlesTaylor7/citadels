 Just build the thing. 
 I can performance tune later.
 I can harden security later.
 I can oxidize the project later.
 I can switch to jinja templates later.
 I can abandon the project altogether if its too distracting.

 ## MVP Features
 - all 54 basic districts
 - only 14 of the 30 unique districts
 - select the 14 easiest to implement. Probably end game scoring.
 - implement the 8 base game characters
 - no config, no timers etc
 - card assets? I might just put the card titles and descriptions
