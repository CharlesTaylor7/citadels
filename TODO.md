    - [ ] Impose username character limit

- Action logs
    - [x] Deterministic rng
    - [ ] Write to file
    - [ ] Restore from file

- UX

## Future Work
- [ ] Linebreaks, italics and bolds in card descriptions.
- [ ] Rethink daisyui theme. Maybe something more blue than beige.

    - [x] Patrician
    - [_] Navigator
    - [_] Scholar
    - [_] Abbot
- [ ] More Districts 


## Severe Issues

## Minor Issues
- [ ] button labels are showing defaults in many places
- [ ] Center draft cards
